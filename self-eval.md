# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
 I was stressed for sure, worked on it for a few hours. Asked for help and I think it's correct now, but still getting an error. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
It's been tougher. I need to plan breaks better.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
Not to freak out and ask for help earlier.
